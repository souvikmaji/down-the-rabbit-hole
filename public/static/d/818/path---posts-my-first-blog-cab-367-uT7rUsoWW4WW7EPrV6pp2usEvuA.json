If you go the github project for the blog you will see a lot of code, which i have not written. Almost all of it is taken from the amazing <a href=\"https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen\">Gatsby Starter Project</a> which I tweaked a little. Shout out to Alexander Shelepenok for the amazing work.</p>\n<p>Come back next week to see a real blog post.
