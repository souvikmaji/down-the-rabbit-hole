Hi, this is my new blog, set up using Gatsby. If you go the github project for the blog you will see a lot of code, which i have not written. Almost all of it is taken from the amazing [Gatsby Starter Project](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) which I tweaked a little. Shout out to Alexander Shelepenok for the amazing work.

Come back next week to see a real blog post. For now enjoy a random image. :-)
